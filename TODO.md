Todo before I'm satisfied (in no particular order):

* Actual GUI (probably web-based)
  * Avatar-generation for fighters
  * Stats for fighters
  * Hall of Fame
* Debug (currently crashes when finishing first non-gen1 fight)
* Add RPG-esque stats
  * Should be sufficient to extend Fighter, BreedingPool and FightClub (potentially just override the turn-handling in FightClub)
  * Spells?!
* Integrate into IM-services
  * IRC
  * Any others?
* Betting on fighters!
